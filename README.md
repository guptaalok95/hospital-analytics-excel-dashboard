**Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Dashboard – Excel Project**

## **📌 Project Overview**
This project focuses on creating an **Emergency Room (ER) Analysis Dashboard** in **Microsoft Excel** to help hospitals monitor performance, improve efficiency, and make data-driven decisions.
Using **Power Query**, **Power Pivot**, **PivotTables**, and **Dashboarding techniques**, this report provides insights into patient flow, waiting times, satisfaction scores, and operational patterns.

## **🎯 Purpose of the Project**
We aim to build a comprehensive **Hospital ER Analysis Dashboard** that:
 * Improves efficiency in monitoring ER operations
 * Provides actionable insights for hospital management
 * Helps stakeholders track patient volume, waiting time, satisfaction, and overall performance
 * Improves decision-making for managing patients and staff allocation
The dashboard serves as a **decision-support tool** to highlight trends, spot bottlenecks, and identify areas that need improvement.

## **📘 Project Steps**
This project was developed by following a structured, step-by-step workflow:

### **1️⃣ Business Requirement Gathering**
Understanding what the hospital needs to monitor:
 ✔ Patient visits
 ✔ Waiting time
 ✔ Satisfaction
 ✔ Daily trends
 ✔ Operational efficiency

### **2️⃣ Understanding the Data**
Review of raw datasets, fields, data types, and potential data quality issues.

* Importing raw datasets into Excel
* Establishing data connections

### **4️⃣ Data Cleaning & Quality Checks (Power Query)**
* Removing duplicate and irrelevant entries
* Handling missing values
* Standardizing column formats

* ### **5️⃣ Creating Calendar Table (Power Query)**
A date table was created for proper time intelligence, trend analysis, and modeling.

### **6️⃣ Data Modeling (Power Pivot)**
* Building relationships between tables
* Designing a star schema
* Ensuring data integrity across the model

### **7️⃣ Adding Required Columns (DAX in Power Pivot)**
* Calculated columns
* Measures for aggregations
* KPIs

### **8️⃣ Creating PivotTables & Dashboard Layout**
* Building KPIs
* Designing the dashboard layout
* Applying slicers and interactive filters

### **9️⃣ Charts Development & Formatting**
